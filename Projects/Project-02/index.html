<h3>Mythological Lyra</h3>
    <p>Lyra represents the lyre of Orpheus, the legendary musician. The instrument was originally created by Hermes and later given to Orpheus, whose music was so powerful that it could charm gods and nature alike. Orpheus nearly succeeded in bringing his wife Eurydice back from the underworld, but he failed at the last moment. After his death, Zeus placed his lyre in the sky.</p>

   <h3>Astronomical Lyra</h3>
   <p>The constellation Lyra is home to Vega, one of the brightest stars in the night sky, located just 25 light-years from Earth. Vega was the North Star around 12,000 BCE and will become the North Star again in about 13,000 years due to precession. Lyra also contains the famous Ring Nebula (M57), a planetary nebula about 2,300 light-years away.</p>

   <h3>Mythological Orion</h3>
    <p>Orion was a mighty hunter in Greek mythology who boasted that he could kill all animals. Hera, displeased by his arrogance, sent the Scorpius constellation to defeat him. To prevent further conflict, Zeus placed Orion and Scorpius on opposite sides of the sky, ensuring that they never appear at the same time.</p>

   <h3>Astronomical Orion</h3>
   <p>Orion is one of the most recognizable constellations in the winter sky, located near the Milky Way and containing many bright stars. Betelgeuse, a red supergiant about 642 light-years away, is expected to go supernova in the future. Rigel, a hot blue supergiant, is approximately 860 light-years away. The Orion Nebula (M42), a stellar nursery, is about 1,344 light-years from Earth.</p>

   <h3>Mythological Andromeda</h3>
   <p>Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, was chained to a rock as a sacrifice after her mother angered Poseidon.

   <h3>Astronomical Draco</h3>
   <p>Draco is a long, winding constellation near the North Star. It contains Thuban (Î± Draconis), a star located about 303 light-years away, which was the North Star around 5,000 years ago due to Earth's axial precession. Another notable star is Eltanin (Î³ Draconis), about 154 light-years away, which will eventually pass close to Earth in the distant future.</p>

   <h3>Astronomical Pegasus</h3>
   <p>Pegasus is known for its "Great Square," a prominent asterism that serves as a guidepost in the autumn sky. The constellation's brightest star, Enif (Îµ Pegasi), is an orange supergiant about 690 light-years away. Pegasus also contains 51 Pegasi, a sun-like star about 50 light-years away, which was the first star discovered to host an exoplanet.
